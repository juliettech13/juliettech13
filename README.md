# Hey nerd 👩🏻‍💻

I'm an ex-diplomat turned software engineer gone founder, obssessed with shrinking your dev tool's "Time To Hello World".

My craft lies in leading, designing, and building easy-to-use developer experiences, creating technical content, and supporting engineers launch products to market.

Improving developer experiences is improving user experiences. I learn fast, adapt easily, and take my information capture system seriously. 

I'm also a certified 200h Hot Yoga Teacher, a Notion consultant, and write a [technical blog](https://juliet.tech).

Hmu for building dev tools 🔥
