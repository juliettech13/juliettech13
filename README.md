I nerd out to developer experiences that are clear but not extensive, actionable yet also insightful, fun while keeping effective.

Originally a diplomat, I learned to code the hard way - stumbling my head to the screen for hours until I understood how things work underneath.

Today, I focus on Developer Relations because I became obssessed with shrinking developer's time to "Time To Hello World".

I believe improving developer's experience is improving user's experience.

I learn fast, adapt easily, and take my information capture system seriously. 

I'm also a certified 200h Hot Yoga Teacher and write a [technical blog](https://juliet.tech).

Hmu if you're into dev tools ðŸ”¥
