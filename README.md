# Hey you ‚ö°Ô∏è

Fancy seeing you here.

I'm on a mission to make web3 so safe and easy-to-use that my grandma uses it daily.

I lead, design & build developer experiences, create educational technical content, and support engineers building digital products at [Cyfrin](https://cyfrin.io). The better the developer experience, the better the user experience will be.

I learn fast, adapt easily, and take my information capture system seriously. I've been practicing hot yoga 26+2 since 2015.

Writing and coding are my preferred mediums for creating leverage. And I'm always a yes for live music and parks üíô.

## What I do üë©üèª‚Äçüíª

- I lead Developer Relations at [Cyfrin](https://cyfrin.io), a Web3 security powerhouse. We host a developer education hub, a competitive auditing platform, an auditor aggregator tool, and a private audits firm.
- On the side, I run [Surge Women](https://surgewomen.io), an organization onboarding women into Web3. Last year we sold out the Surge Passport NFT collection in less than a week - 5k utility NFTs providing token-holders with crypto opportunities, access to events, and free/discounted education.
- I also [speak](https://juliet.tech/talks) at major crypto conferences and unversities, write a weekly newsletter called [nerd_splash](https://juliet.tech/newsletter) and post about startups, travel, and investing in my [personal blog](https://juliet.tech).
