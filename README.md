Fancy seeing you here.

Ex-diplomat turned Software Engineer gone Founder. I build projects, nerd out on crypto agents, teach software engineering, and throw summer camps for founders.

My craft lies in leading, designing & building developer experiences, creating educational technical content, and supporting engineers launching products to market.

Big believer that the better the developer experience, the better the user experience will be for the end user.

I learn fast, adapt easily, and take my information capture system seriously. I've been practicing hot yoga 26+2 since 2015 and currently doing my 200h YTT.

Writing and coding are my preferred mediums for creating leverage. And I'm always a yes for live music and parks üíô.

## Some background about me üë©üèª‚Äçüíª
